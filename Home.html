                <p>
                  Hello, my name is Jack Steiner and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic and professional career, 
                  I have developed a strong passion for software development and programming. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in this field.

                  During my time at Mount Royal University, I gained a solid foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, 
                  and software development methodologies. I was also involved in several projects that allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world scenarios. 
                  These experiences have taught me how to work effectively as part of a team, communicate technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders, 
                  and solve complex problems using innovative solutions.
                  
                  As a software developer, I am highly motivated to create software that is both functional and user-friendly. 
                  I am experienced in using a variety of programming languages and tools, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and 
                  techniques to improve my skills. I am also committed to delivering projects on time and within budget, while maintaining a high standard of quality.

                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>
                  Aside from my technical skills, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who enjoys collaborating with others to achieve common goals. 
                  I am an effective communicator and a proactive problem-solver, and I am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that a project is successful.

                  In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology trends, reading about new software development techniques, 
                  and participating in online programming communities. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and camping, which allow me to recharge and stay focused.
